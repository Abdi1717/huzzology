# Active Context

## Current Focus
Successfully resolved webpack module loading errors in the LifeFlow4 dashboard and optimized the dynamic import system for better performance and reliability.

## Recent Changes
- **Fixed Webpack Module Loading Error**: Resolved `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')` error by simplifying the `lazyImport` utility function
- **Simplified Dynamic Imports**: Replaced complex module resolution logic with standard Next.js dynamic import patterns
- **Fixed JSX Syntax Error**: Corrected JSX syntax in loading functions by using `React.createElement` instead of JSX in non-JSX contexts
- **Optimized Dashboard Layout**: Simplified provider loading pattern to use direct imports instead of complex dynamic loading
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error boundaries and fallback mechanisms for failed module imports

## Current Development State

### Recently Completed
- **Dashboard Loading Fix**: Dashboard now loads successfully (HTTP 200) without webpack errors
- **Module Resolution**: All dynamic imports now use standard Next.js patterns for better reliability
- **Provider Optimization**: Context providers load directly without unnecessary dynamic wrapping
- **Error Boundary Improvements**: Better error handling for component loading failures

### Current Architecture Status
- **Dashboard Structure**: Basic dashboard layout with navigation working correctly
- **Task Management**: Integration with Taskmaster MCP for AI-powered task breakdown
- **Network Management**: Contact management and relationship tracking components
- **Notes System**: Markdown editor with syntax highlighting
- **Commute Planning**: Basic route planning and travel management
- **Personal Radar**: Analytics and insights dashboard for productivity tracking

### Technical Improvements Made
- **Simplified lazyImport Utility**: Removed complex module resolution logic that was causing webpack issues
- **Standard Dynamic Imports**: All components now use Next.js `dynamic()` with proper error handling
- **JSX Syntax Compliance**: Fixed React.createElement usage in non-JSX contexts
- **Provider Loading**: Direct imports for context providers instead of dynamic loading
- **Error Recovery**: Better fallback mechanisms for failed component loads

## Next Steps
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting for large visualization components
- **Error Monitoring**: Add comprehensive error tracking for production deployment
- **Component Testing**: Verify all dashboard components load correctly in different scenarios
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Document new patterns and architectural decisions
- **User Experience**: Test dashboard functionality and user workflows

## Development Patterns Established
- **Standard Dynamic Imports**: Use Next.js `dynamic()` with proper loading states
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement fallback components for failed imports
- **Context Provider Patterns**: Direct imports for providers, dynamic imports for heavy components
- **JSX Compliance**: Use `React.createElement` in utility functions, JSX only in components
- **Module Resolution**: Avoid complex module resolution logic in favor of standard patterns

## Current Development State

### Completed Components
- **Dashboard Structure**: Basic dashboard layout with navigation
- **Task Management**: Integration with Taskmaster MCP for AI-powered task breakdown
- **Network Visualization**: D3.js and Visx-based network graphs
- **Commute Planning**: Basic commute management features
- **Notes System**: Markdown-based note-taking with editor
- **Radar/Analytics**: Personal insights and analytics dashboard

### Active Development Areas
- **System Memory Integration**: Establishing persistent context across sessions
- **Component Documentation**: Maintaining ShadCN-context.md with all UI components
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensuring WCAG AA compliance across all features
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis and optimization strategies

### Technical Debt
- **Test Coverage**: Need to expand unit and integration test coverage
- **Documentation**: Some components need better JSDoc documentation
- **Performance**: Some D3 visualizations need optimization
- **Accessibility**: Audit needed for complex interactive components

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Test Memory Bank System**: Verify that memory persistence works across sessions
2. **Update ShadCN Context**: Ensure all current components are documented
3. **Accessibility Audit**: Run accessibility tests on existing components
4. **Performance Review**: Analyze current bundle size and optimization opportunities

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add unit tests for critical components
2. **Documentation Sprint**: Complete JSDoc for all custom components
3. **Component Optimization**: Optimize heavy visualization components
4. **User Experience Polish**: Refine interactions and animations

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Advanced Features**: Implement advanced task management features
2. **Integration Enhancements**: Deeper GitHub MCP integration
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure excellent mobile experience
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring and alerts

## Development Patterns in Use

### Current Workflow
- **Plan Mode**: Analyze requirements and design approach
- **Memory Consultation**: Read memory-bank files before starting work
- **Rule Adherence**: Follow established patterns from `.cursor/rules/`
- **Act Mode**: Execute planned changes with user approval
- **Memory Update**: Update memory bank after significant changes

### Integration Points
- **Taskmaster MCP**: Active for task breakdown and management
- **GitHub MCP**: Ready for automated commits and project management
- **Context7 MCP**: Available for knowledge management and research
- **ShadCN UI**: Primary component library with documented usage

## Known Issues
- **Bundle Size**: Some D3 imports are causing larger than desired bundle sizes
- **Accessibility**: Complex visualizations need accessibility improvements
- **Performance**: Initial load time could be optimized
- **Mobile**: Some dashboard components need mobile-specific optimizations

## Success Metrics
- **Memory Persistence**: Context successfully maintained across sessions
- **Development Speed**: Faster development with established patterns
- **Code Quality**: Consistent patterns and high-quality implementations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance maintained
- **Performance**: Bundle size under control, fast load times
