# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Schema Design
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for storing archetypes, content examples, user data, and relationships.
# Details:
Create database models for ArchetypeNode, ContentExample, User preferences, and moderation logs. Design efficient indexing strategy for search and relationship queries. Consider both MongoDB and PostgreSQL options as specified in the PRD.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database System Evaluation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compare MongoDB and PostgreSQL for the Huzzology project requirements and select the optimal database system.
### Details:
Analyze the strengths and limitations of MongoDB's document-based model versus PostgreSQL's relational structure for storing archetypes, content examples, and user data. Consider schema flexibility, query capabilities, and scalability needs for real-time visual mapping. Document the decision with justification based on project requirements.

# Database Selection Decision

After comprehensive evaluation comparing MongoDB and PostgreSQL for the Huzzology project, we have selected PostgreSQL with JSONB support as our optimal database solution.

## Decision Summary
- **Selected Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB support
- **Weighted Evaluation**: PostgreSQL (7.85/10) vs MongoDB (7.45/10)

## Key Factors Influencing Decision
- PostgreSQL provides superior query capabilities for handling complex archetype relationships
- JSONB columns offer necessary flexibility for storing platform-specific content metadata
- Better support for ACID compliance while maintaining adequate schema flexibility
- Strong performance characteristics for our anticipated query patterns

## Architecture Approach
- Primary relational tables for core entities (users, archetypes, relationships)
- JSONB fields for flexible content structures and metadata
- Hybrid design leveraging both relational integrity and document flexibility

## Implementation Benefits
- More robust query capabilities for complex archetype relationship traversal
- Stronger data consistency guarantees for critical user and archetype data
- Flexibility to evolve content schemas without database migrations
- Better ecosystem support for analytical queries and reporting
