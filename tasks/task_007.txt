# Task ID: 7
# Title: ReactFlow Graph Visualization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the interactive graph visualization using ReactFlow and Dagre for displaying archetype relationships.
# Details:
Enhance the existing ReactFlow implementation in the GraphVisualization component with custom node components for archetypes. The foundation is already in place with GraphVisualization component, ArchetypeNode component, layout algorithms including Dagre, GraphDemo page, type definitions, and mock data. Focus on improving performance, interaction, styling, and responsiveness while building upon the work done in Task 4.6.

# Test Strategy:
Test graph rendering with various data sizes, verify interactions work smoothly, and ensure responsive design functions on different screen sizes. Use the existing GraphDemo page as a testing ground for new features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize ReactFlow Performance for Large Datasets [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the existing GraphVisualization component to handle large datasets efficiently by implementing virtualization and optimizing render cycles.
### Details:
Implement node virtualization to only render visible nodes. Add memoization for node and edge components using React.memo. Optimize the layout algorithm in client/src/lib/graph-layout.ts to reduce computation time. Implement progressive loading for large graphs. Use React's useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

# Performance Optimization Plan for Large Datasets

## Node Virtualization Implementation
- Modify client/src/components/graph/GraphVisualization.tsx to leverage ReactFlow's built-in virtualization
- Update nodeTypes configuration with proper memoization
- Enable virtual/infinite viewport option to render only visible nodes

## Memoization Strategy
- Add custom equality function to React.memo for ArchetypeNode to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement useMemo for computed values (stats, layout options)
- Apply useCallback to all event handlers in GraphVisualization.tsx

## Layout Algorithm Optimization
- Optimize force-directed layout algorithm in graph-layout.ts for large datasets
- Create "simplified" mode with fewer iterations for large graphs
- Implement worker-based computation to prevent UI blocking during layout calculations

## Progressive Loading Implementation
- Add pagination for graph data loading
- Implement level-of-detail rendering (simplify distant nodes)
- Create loading indicators and progress feedback
- Develop "load more" mechanism for expanding the visible graph

## React Performance Optimizations
- Apply React.memo consistently across all components
- Replace anonymous functions with useCallback
- Implement custom equality checks for React.memo
- Use useTransition for non-critical updates to prevent main thread blocking

These optimizations will improve both initial load performance and interaction performance (zoom, pan, selection) for large datasets.

## 2. Enhance Edge Styling and Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Improve the visual representation of edges between nodes with custom edge types, styling options, and interactive features.
### Details:
Create custom edge components with different styles (straight, bezier, step) to complement the existing ArchetypeNode component. Implement edge labels with proper positioning. Add visual indicators for edge direction and relationship types. Implement hover effects for edges to highlight connected nodes. Use CSS variables for consistent styling and theming.
<info added on 2025-06-04T19:47:08.214Z>
Create custom edge components in client/src/components/graph/ with three types: StraightEdge, BezierEdge, and StepEdge, each handling different relationship types (influence, similarity, evolution). Develop an EdgeLabel component using SVG for precise positioning with smart placement to avoid overlap and tooltips for additional information. Implement visual indicators including customizable arrowheads, color coding, line patterns (solid, dashed, dotted), and animated flow indicators for directional edges. Add hover state highlighting that also highlights connected nodes, provides visual feedback for interactive edges, and includes subtle animations for transitions. Establish CSS variables that support light/dark themes and responsive styling. Implement edge interaction features including click handlers for detailed information, context menu support, edge selection with keyboard modifiers, and visual feedback for selected edges. Build all components as React functional components with TypeScript typing and memoization for optimal performance.

Successfully implemented animation and transition effects for the graph visualization using Framer Motion. Created a comprehensive animation system with utility file client/src/utils/animation.ts containing various animation variants (nodeAnimationVariants, edgeAnimationVariants, layoutAnimationVariants, expandCollapseVariants, filterAnimationVariants). 

Developed specialized animated components including AnimatedArchetypeNode.tsx with entrance/exit animations and hover effects, AnimatedBezierEdge.tsx with path drawing animations, AnimatedStepEdge.tsx for hierarchical relationships, and AnimatedStraightEdge.tsx for direct relationships.
