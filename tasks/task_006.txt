# Task ID: 6
# Title: Content Classification Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the AI-powered content classification system using embeddings and LLMs to cluster content into archetypes.
# Details:
Integrate OpenAI/Cohere APIs for generating embeddings and clustering similar content. Implement algorithms to identify emerging archetypes and calculate influence scores. Build the foundation for automated archetype labeling.

# Test Strategy:
Test classification accuracy with known archetype examples. Verify clustering algorithms produce meaningful groups and influence scores are calculated correctly.
