# Task ID: 5
# Title: Data Scraping Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the data ingestion system for scraping content from TikTok, Twitter/X, Instagram, and Reddit.
# Details:
Build scraping modules using Puppeteer/Playwright for each platform. Implement rate limiting, proxy rotation, and respectful scraping practices. Create data processing pipeline to extract metadata and standardize content format.
