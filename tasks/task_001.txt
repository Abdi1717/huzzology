# CI/CD Pipeline and Testing Framework Implementation Plan

## Testing Framework Setup
- Install and configure Jest for all workspaces (client, server, shared)
- Add React Testing Library for client-side component testing
- Implement Supertest for server-side API testing
- Configure test utilities and helpers for common testing scenarios
- Update all package.json files with appropriate testing dependencies
- Create sample tests in each workspace to validate configuration

## GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
- Create workflow configuration files (.github/workflows)
- Configure parallel jobs for testing, linting, and build verification
- Implement proper caching strategies for node_modules and build artifacts
- Set up test coverage reporting with defined thresholds
- Configure automated PR checks and status reporting
- Ensure pipeline runs on pull requests and main branch commits

## Integration
- Create unified test scripts in root package.json for running all tests
- Document testing approach and CI/CD pipeline in project documentation
- Verify complete pipeline functionality with test PRs
